# FashionMNIST Model Training
This repository contains code for training a deep learning model on the [Fashion MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist) dataset. Fashion MNIST is a dataset of grayscale images of 10 different clothing types, designed to serve as a drop-in replacement for the classic MNIST dataset.

### Getting Started
Follow the instructions below to set up and train a model on the Fashion MNIST dataset.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Libraries: Install the required packages by running:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
- requirements.txt should include libraries like:
  tensorflow
  keras
  numpy
  matplotlib
Note: You can also use Google Colab for training without any local setup. If so, upload the notebook file directly or access it via GitHub.

### Dataset
The Fashion MNIST dataset can be loaded directly from TensorFlow/Keras datasets:
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import fashion_mnist
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = fashion_mnist.load_data()

Fashion MNIST consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each with a resolution of 28x28 pixels.

### Training the Model
- Open the Notebook: Use the FashionMNIST_Training.ipynb notebook in this repository.

- Load the Dataset: The notebook contains code to load and preprocess the dataset.

- Define the Model: The notebook provides a basic convolutional neural network (CNN) for image 
  classification, but you can customize it.

- Train the Model: Run the training cell to start the training process. Adjust the hyperparameters (like epochs, batch size, and learning rate) as needed.


 Example training code
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))

### Evaluating the Model
Once the model is trained, evaluate its performance on the test set to check the accuracy and loss.

Load the model:

from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
model = load_model('fashion_mnist_model.h5')

Evaluate:

test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)
print("Test Accuracy: ", test_accuracy)
