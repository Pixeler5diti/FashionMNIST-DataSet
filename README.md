#FashionMNIST Model Training
This repository contains code for training a deep learning model on the Fashion MNIST dataset. Fashion MNIST is a dataset of grayscale images of 10 different clothing types, designed to serve as a drop-in replacement for the classic MNIST dataset.

IST dataset.

Requirements
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

Libraries: Install the required packages by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
requirements.txt should include libraries like:

txt
Copy code
tensorflow
keras
numpy
matplotlib
Note: You can also use Google Colab for training without any local setup. If so, upload the notebook file directly or access it via GitHub.

Dataset
The Fashion MNIST dataset can be loaded directly from TensorFlow/Keras datasets:

python
Copy code
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import fashion_mnist
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = fashion_mnist.load_data()
Fashion MNIST consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each with a resolution of 28x28 pixels.

Training the Model
Open the Notebook: Use the FashionMNIST_Training.ipynb notebook in this repository.

Load the Dataset: The notebook contains code to load and preprocess the dataset.

Define the Model: The notebook provides a basic convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification, but you can customize it.

Train the Model: Run the training cell to start the training process. Adjust the hyperparameters (like epochs, batch size, and learning rate) as needed.

python
Copy code
# Example training code
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))
Save the Model: After training, the model can be saved for future use.
python
Copy code
model.save('fashion_mnist_model.h5')
Evaluating the Model
Once the model is trained, evaluate its performance on the test set to check the accuracy and loss.

python
Copy code
# Load the model
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
model = load_model('fashion_mnist_model.h5')

# Evaluate
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)
print("Test Accuracy: ", test_accuracy)
